### I'm ferretcode

![ferretcode's GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ferretcode&count_private=true)

I'm a developer who is always looking to make something new. I know languages such as C#, C++, Lua, Ruby, Python, and more. My favorite language to work with is Node.JS.
I'm actively developing a simple discord.js wrapper, a JSON library to make JSON easy in Node.JS called my-dog-likes-cheese, an HTTP library named after my cat, and have worked on many projects such as https://raspberryproxies.com. (dead)

I sell services on Fiverr as well, making Node projects and Discord bots.
