### I'm FerretCode

I'm a developer who is always looking to make something new. I know languages such as C#, C++, Lua, Ruby, Python, and many more. My favorite currently is Node.JS.
I'm actively developing a JSON library to make JSON easy in Node.JS called my-dog-likes-cheese, and have worked on many projects such as https://raspberryproxies.com.
If you need to contact me the best way is to DM me on Discord. My username is amara#9019.
