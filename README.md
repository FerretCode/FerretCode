### I'm FerretCode

I'm a developer who is always looking to make something new. I know languages such as C#, C++, Lua, Ruby, Python, and more. My favorite language to work with is Node.JS.
I'm actively developing a JSON library to make JSON easy in Node.JS called my-dog-likes-cheese, an HTTP library named after my cat, and have worked on many projects such as https://raspberryproxies.com. (dead)

I sell services on Fiverr as well, making Node projects and Discord bots.
